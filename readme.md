# Norges Fund Analysis

## Motivation
I am kind of interested in programming, economics and fascinated by norway and its fund. All three combined, has led me to write irregularly (since 2020) but every now and then on this little Python script.

## User Manual
Unfortunately, using the program with the current version is not very user-friendly.
Therefore, I will try to answer all the important points in this section.

### Prerequisites
Python Interpreter: v3.9 is installed and functioning on the computer.
The Python packages are installed and ready for usage.

### Preparations for use
Preparations are required so that the program can be used successfully and companies can be analyzed for key figures. 
These are described in this section.

#### Where does the data for a company analysis come from ?
Norges Bank provides all data and investments. 
For the analysis, they are required and to be downloaded. 
The files can be downloaded here: https://www.nbim.no/en/the-fund/investments/#/
Afterwards please reference the file path in  `user_config.py`.

#### How the program works 
For the execution of the script there are actually basically only two paths

### Usage


### Hints


## Possible Improvements
- Improved Config adujstments 
- Error Handling.
